This part of the freeCodeCamp turned to be in general a algorithm solver then I only uploaded the projects that I think that are somehow different: [Palindrome Checker](https://github.com/lirbre/FCC-projects/tree/Javascript/001%20-%20Palindrome%20Checker) was a great issue of countless conditions and to make it works fine was really a problem. And the [Cash Register](https://github.com/lirbre/FCC-projects/tree/Javascript/005%20-%20Cash%20Register) was by far the most difficult problem that I have faced until now.
I'm anxious for see what was coming next this.
